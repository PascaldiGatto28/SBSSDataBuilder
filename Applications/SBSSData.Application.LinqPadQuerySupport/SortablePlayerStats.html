            These tables display all player stats in any league and in the summary of the community and competitive leagues. What is 
            particularly helpful is that the tables are all sortable by any table column header. For example, to see the player with the most
            home runs in the Coyote League, open that league table and then click on the "HR" column header. When you click on a column header, the table
            is sorted in descending order for numeric values. For the name column, the table is sorted is ascending order by the last name of the player.
            If you click on the same header again, the order is reversed (ascending for numeric and descending for player last name). Finally for example,
            clicking on the "HR" column header, shows you to HR-leader for that league.

            Becuase Community and Competitive that have multiple leagues, there are tables with the summary data for all Community and Competive leagues. 
            Each of the summary tables, include data for all players that have played in any or all of one of these leagues.
