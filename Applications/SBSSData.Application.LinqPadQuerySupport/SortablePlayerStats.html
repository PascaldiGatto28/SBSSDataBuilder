            These tables display all player stats and statistics in any league and the summary of the community and competitive 
            leagues. What is 
            particularly helpful is that the player tables are all sortable by any stat or statistic. 
            See the section <a href="../AboutTables.html#SortableTables">Sortable Tables</a> in the
            SBSS Data Viewer "AboutTables" page for details about table sorting.

            Because Community and Competitive that have multiple leagues, there are tables with the summary data for all 
            Community and Competitive leagues. 
            Each of the summary tables include data for all players that have played in any of those leagues.

            Z-scores for the computed stats (AVG, SLG, OBP, OPS) are the statistics display for each player. The default
            is not to display these statistics, but if you click the "Display/Hide Statistics" button 
            &ndash; it's a toggle &ndash; the statistics are hidden or displayed. When displayed, a table of the league
            descriptive statistics are displayed as well. Finally, even if you choose not to display statistics, 
            when you hover over
            a player name their image and computed stats and z-Scores are displayed. It's a convenient summary
            without having to display all the statistics.
