        About Data Viewer Tables

    </h1>

        <div>
        The following
        <a href="#tableFrame">table</a> is typical. We'll use it to describe the general anatomy of a Data Viewer table, it's
        properties and features.
        </div>

        <div class="spacer">
            <h2>Anatomy of a Table</h2>

            Data Viewer tables are just a special case of all HTML tables. But the parts of the table are specialized
            and useful to know how they are used. HTML tables are just columns (vertical) and rows (horizontal) that
            displays data in each cell (intersection of a row and column) context and meaning. There are
            three components: Header, Body and Footer. The sample table is the most common Data Viewer
            table &mdash; player stats table. The <a href="#sampleTable"> same table</a> is "live" so you can
            inspect and click away to see how it works.

            <div class="spacer">
                <h3>Header</h3>
                <div class="spacer">
                    The header consists of two rows: the top row (header text) is
                    <span class="highlight headerText">
                        displayed using these background and text colors
                    </span>
                    and provides information
                    about the table contents (the cells). It's a special row because it spans all the columns in the table.
                    You can expand or collapse the table by clicking on the header text
                    or the small triangle
                    (<span class="highlight headerText" style="font-size:.75em">▼</span> or
                    <span class="highlight headerText" style="font-size:.75em">▲</span>)
                    to the left of text.
                    When you click on the text (or triangle), the visibility of the table changes. If is totally visible, it will
                    be collapsed to show only the header description. Click on it again and the full table is expanded and scrolled
                    into view.

                    When a table is
                    expanded, the triangle is up; when collapsed it is down. Another visibility indication is when the
                    table is expanded,
                    the bottom border of the header text is solid; when collapsed it is dashed.
                    <button class="showme" onclick="toggle('t1');">Try it!</button>
                </div>

                <div class="spacer">
                    The second row of the header contains the column headers. This row is
                    <span class="highlight columnHeader">
                        displayed using these background and text colors.
                    </span>
                    It displays text that describes the data in each cell of the column. For player stats, the abbreviations are
                    standard, but for some tables that may not be the case. If you hover the 
                    column header with your mouse, a small
                    "pop-up" is displayed for a few seconds describing the data.
                    For example, when you hover over the "TH" column header, you'll see
                    <div class="spacer">
                        <img src="Images/ColumnHeaderHover.png" />
                    </div>
                    Move your cursor over the column headers and try it!
                    Expanding, collapsing and column descriptions work in exactly the same way for all Data Viewer tables not just
                    the player stats tables.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="spacer">
                <h3>Body</h3>
                <div class="spacer">
                    This section is where all the data is displayed. If you focus on the rows, what you see are the various
                    data items for that specific item &mdash; in our example the player. If you focus on the columns within
                    the body, you see all particular data items (in our example, the stat) for each players. So the intersection
                    of a row and column (a cell) is a particular data item for a particular player.
                </div>
                <div class="spacer">
                    There are Data Viewer tables for which rows are teams, a single game, or even a season. The cells can contain
                    a table. For example in the in the "Games, Teams and Players" page, there's a table for each league, for
                    example "Monday Community." This is a special kind of table where the body of the table contains just
                    a single cell for each row. Each row represents a perspective of the all stats data and cell is just another
                    table. The first row is the "Game Results Data" for all the played games. Each row represents a played game,
                    the cell of which is the table "Scheduled Game Information", and the second cell "Teams and Players" for
                    this game is a table having all the stats data of the played game. This table contains columns for the
                    team name, runs scored, hits, win or loss, and then another table having all the player data.
                    <div class="spacer">
                        <img style="width:700px;" src="D:\Users\Richard\Documents\Visual Studio 2022\Github Projects\SBSS\SBSSDataBuilder\Applications\SBSSData.Application.WebSiteLocal\Images\ComplexTableSummary.png" />
                    </div>
                    The player data is much like our sample table. You can see how powerful tables can be in organizing
                    mountains of data in a way the data can be viewed and summarized. The "Games, Teams and Players" page
                    contains every bit of league, team and player data for the season.

                <div class="spacer">
                    <h3>Footer</h3>
                    The table is the last raw of the table and is used to summarize the data in the body. 
                    This row is
                    <span class="highlight columnHeader">
                        displayed using these background and text colors.
                    </span>

        <div class="spacer">
            Data are presented in tables that are "collapsible", "sticky" and for player stats data "sortable."

                Collapsible &mdash;
                When there's a lot of data and many tables, navigation can be a bit imposing. But all tables can
                be collapsed or expanded by clicking on the table header anywhere within the text of the table header. Just
                before the header text, you see a "down arrow" if the table is current expanded and an "up arrow" if it collapsed.
                The header text acts as a toggle: Clicking on a table that is collapsed expands it (that is shows all table
                data); click on a table this is expanded, collapsed it (that shows just the header and its text).

                <div class="spacer">
                    And when there are a
                    lot of tables, buttons are available to collapse or expand all tables on the page. Try clicking on the table header below.
                    When a table is expanded, the arrow to the left of the header text is up and the bottom border of the table is solid.
                    If the arrow is down
                    and the bottom border is dashed, the table is collapsed and can be expanded, by clicking on the header text
                </div>
            </li>
        </ul>

        
        <!--<div>

            and the bottom border is dashed, the table is collapsed and can be expanded, by clicking on the header text. Finally
            the table column header text is "sticky" &mdash; when you scroll down, and the table is visible, the table header
            remain attached
            to the top of browser until you scroll past the table.
