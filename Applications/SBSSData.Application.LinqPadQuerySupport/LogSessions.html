            The <span class="tableTitle">Data Store Information</span> table 
            describes the state of the file where all information is stored (the <span class="emphasis">Data Store</span>). 
            It is updated every 
            weekday evening at 8:30 PM.
            This table gives you an idea of the volume of data and how it's changing.

            used to make sure that operations are working correctly, but it is interesting it its own right. The
            system is robust and provides confidence that all the data is recovered correctly.
