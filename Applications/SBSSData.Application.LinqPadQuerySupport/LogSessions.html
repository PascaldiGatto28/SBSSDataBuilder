            The <span class="tableTitle">Data Store Information</span> table 
            describes the state of the file (<span class="emphasis">Data Store</span>) where all information gathered
            from the SSSA is stored.
            It is updated every 
            weekday evening at 8:30 PM.
            This table gives you an idea of the volume of data and how it's changing. For season already completed is a complete
            record for that season

        <div class="spacer">
            Following is a log of all the changes that are made to the Data Store for the current
            season (no matter what season you've selected) during the nightly updates. It's
            used to make sure that operations are working correctly, but it is interesting it its own right. The
            system is robust and provides confidence that all the data is recovered correctly.
