            The <span class="tableTitle">Data Store Information</span> table is not really about games played,
            but describes the state of the file where all information is stored (the Data Store). It is updated at least every 
            weekday evening at 8:30 PM.
            This table gives you an idea of the volume of data and how it is changing. It is displayed
            on each of the data pages.

            Following is a log of all the changes that are made to the Data Store during those nightly updates. Its use
            is primarily to make sure that operations are working correctly, but it is interesting it its own right. If an error
            occurs it is reported (see March 6) and usually caused by inability to access the SSSA web site. If you look at the
            early March 7 data, you'll see that it successfully updated the Data Store at that time. An important point is that the
            system is robust and provides confidence that all the data is recovered.
