            Data used by this application (SBSS Data Viewer) is gathered by "scraping" the pages of the SaddleBrooke Senior Softball
            Association (SSSA) web site and then saving to a formatted (JSON) file called the <b>Data Store</b>. After teams have
            been built but before any games are played, the SSSA site posts a schedule of all games. At this time, the Data Store
            is created and has information for scheduled games, but nothing else. As games are played information from those
            games, namely the players' "box scores," are used to update the Data Store. Having all the data in a single file 
            makes it much easier to search, create summaries of data and display the results.

            All the updates to the data originate from the volunteer score keepers and then are posted to the
            <a href="https://saddlebrookesoftball.com" target="_blank">
                SaddleBrooke Senior Softball Association (SSSA)
            </a> web site by the site manager. It's an incredible amount of work that's very well done.

            There are three fundamental ways of looking at this data: (1) From the perspective of game results; (2) focus on
            the teams; (3) from the players' view. The purpose of this page is to put all this information in a three main
            tables for each of the leagues aligning with these different perspectives. In addition, you'll see a table that just
            describes the current state of the Data Store (file). As of the this writing, there are over 1,100 tables
            representing the current season, some of which
            are nested deeply in other tables. That volume is the driver for allowing tables to be collapsed in order
            to make navigation easier. Expanding all the tables can take a couple of seconds &mdash; be patient please.

                Before diving into and looking at all the data tables, you'll find it useful to take a look at details as you're are guided
                you through the
                different tables. The guide is here:
                <div class="spacer" style="text-align:center">
                    <a href="GamesTeamPlayersHelpV3.html" target="_blank">Guide to Games Results, Teams and Players</a>.
                </div>
                In the guide, when describing the details of a table, you can open it to follow along, or just click on the
                "Show me"
                button, and the table automatically opens for you. Try it!
