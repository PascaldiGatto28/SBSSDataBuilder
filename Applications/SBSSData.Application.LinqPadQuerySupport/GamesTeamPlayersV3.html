            There are three fundamental ways of looking at this data: (1) From the perspective of game results; (2) focus on
            the teams; (3) from the players' view. The purpose of this page is to put all this information in a three main
            tables for each of the leagues aligning with these different perspectives.
           
            That volume of the data is the driver for allowing tables to be collapsed in order
            to make navigation easier. Expanding all the tables can take a couple of seconds &mdash; be patient please.

                Before diving into and looking at all the data tables, you'll find it useful to take a look at details as 
                you're guided you through the
                different tables. The guide is here:
