        Using live sample tables, this page lets you explore the features and properties of SBSS Data View tables.
        We have two samples: The first is a single table of player stats together with summary stats (in this case for the league);
        The second is a fragment from the "Game Results, Teams and Players" page which illustrates tables nested within other tables
        and how to navigate through them all. Both samples can be displayed in a pop-up window by clicking either the "Open Sample
        Table" or "Open Nested Tables" buttons.

    <div class="spacer">
        It's a much better experience viewing this page on a desktop, laptop or other device using a full-screen because they have more
        screen "real estate" than a phone. Go ahead and click on the buttons. You can close the pop-up by clicking anywhere away
        from it, or using the "Close the Pop-up"
        button at the top of the pop-up. If you change the view, you can click
        the "Reload the Pop-up" button to recover the original view. Don't forget to come back!

        <h2>Anatomy of a Table</h2>

        Data Viewer tables are just a special case of HTML tables. But the parts of the table are specialized,
        and it's useful to know how they are used. HTML tables are just columns (vertical) and rows (horizontal) that
        display data in each cell (intersection of a row and column) giving context and meaning. There are
        three components of a table: Header, Body and Footer. The "Sample Table" is the most common Data Viewer
        table &mdash; a player stats table. The <a style="color:#00ee" onclick="openPopup('SampleTable')">Sample Table</a>
        is "live" so you can
        inspect to see how it works while reading this document.

        <div class="spacer">
            <h3>Header</h3>
            <div class="spacer">
                The header consists of two rows: the top row (header text) is
                <span class="highlight headerRootText">
                    displayed using these background and text colors
                </span>
                for top-level tables, and
                <span class="highlight headerNestedText">
                    displayed using these background and text colors
                </span>
                for nested tables. A table is nested if it is the contents of table cell &mdash; see
                <a onclick="openPopup('SampleGTPTables');" style="color:#00ee;">Nested Tables</a>.
                The header text provides information
                about the table contents (the cells). It's a special row because it spans all the columns in the table.
                You can expand or collapse the table by clicking on the header text
                or the small triangle
                (<span style="font-size:.75em">▼</span> or
                <span style="font-size:.75em">▲</span>)
                to the left of text. You <span style="font-weight:700; color:Red;">must click on the text or triangle</span> not
                just anywhere in the row to collapse or expand!
            </div>
            <div class="spacer">
                When you click on the text (or triangle), the visibility of the table changes. If is totally visible, it will
                be collapsed to show only the header description. Click on it again and the full table is expanded and scrolled
                into view.
                See <a href="#tableProperties">Table Properties</a> for details, or better yet,
                <a onclick="openPopup('SampleTable')" style="color: #00ee">try it yourself!</a>
            </div>

            <div class="spacer">
                The second row of the header contains the column headers. This row is
                <span class="highlight columnHeader">
                    displayed using these background and text colors.
                </span>
                It displays text that describes the data in each cell of the column. For player stats, the
                <a href="References.html#Abbreviations" target="_blank">Batting Abbreviations</a>
                are
                standard, but for some tables that may not be the case. If you hover the
                column header with your mouse, a
                "tool-tip" is displayed describing the data while your cursor remains over the header cell.
                <a onclick="openPopup('SampleTable')" style="color: #0000ee">Try it yourself, hovering over the TB header!</a>
            </div>
            <div class="spacer">
                Expanding, collapsing and column descriptions work in exactly the same way for all Data Viewer tables not just
                the player stats tables.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="spacer">
            <h3>Body</h3>
            <div class="spacer">
                This section is where all the data is displayed. If you focus on the rows, what you see are the various
                data items for that specific row &mdash; in our example the player. If you focus on the columns within
                the body, you see all particular data items (in our example, the stats) for each of the players. So the intersection
                of a row and column (a cell) is a particular data item (a player stat) for a particular player.
            </div>
            <div class="spacer">
                There are Data Viewer tables for which rows are teams, a single game, or even a season. The cells can contain
                a table. For example in the in the "Games, Teams and Players" page, there's a table for each league, for
                example "Monday Community." This is a special kind of table where the body of the table contains just
                a single cell for each row. Each row represents a perspective of the all stats data and the cell is just another
                table. The first row is the "Game Results Data" for all the played games. Each row represents a played game,
                the cell of which is the table "Scheduled Game Information", and the second cell "Teams and Players" for
                this game is a table having all the stats data of the played game. This table contains columns for the
                team name, runs scored, hits, win or loss, and then another table having all the player data. Whew, you really
                need to check out
                <a onclick="openPopup('SampleGTPTables')" style="color:#00ee">Games, Teams and Players</a> to make sense of all
                this.
            </div>
            <div class="spacer">
                The player data (the table that is nested 3 tables deep) is much like our sample table.
                You can see how powerful tables can be in organizing
                mountains of data in a way the data can be viewed and summarized. The
                <a href="DocHtml/GamesTeamPlayersSample.html" target="_blank">Game Results, Teams and Players</a> page
                contains every bit of league, team and player data for the season. A lot of tables and a lot a data.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="spacer">
            <h3>Footer</h3>
            <div class="spacer">
                The footer is the last row of the table and is used to summarize the data in the body.
                This row is
                <span class="highlight columnHeader">
                    displayed using these background and text colors.
                </span>
                For some tables, there is no summary data and for those tables, no footer is displayed. In the
                <a onclick="openPopup('SampleGTPTables')" style="color:#00ee">Nested Tables</a> sample, the player stats
                are summarized three different ways: player stats for each game, player stats for each team, and finally
                players stats for the league.

        </div>

    <div class="spacer" id="tableProperties">
        <h2>Table Properties</h2>

        Data Viewer tables are collapsible, sticky and for player stats tables, sortable.

            <h3>Collapsing Multiple Tables</h3>
            <div class="spacer">
                When there's a lot of data it can be hard to navigate the many tables by collapsing or expanding one
                table at a time
                clicking the header top row text. In this case you'll see buttons that allow you collapse or expand all
                the tables at once as the <a onclick="openPopup('SampleGTPTables')" style="color:#00ee">Nested Tables</a> sample
                illustrates.
            </div>

            <div class="span">
                When a table is expanded, the triangle to the left of the header text is "up"
                (<span style="font-size:.75em">▲</span>) and the bottom border of the header text row is solid. When
                the table is collapsed, you only see the top header row, its triangle is down
                <span style="font-size:.75em">▼</span>, and the bottom border of the header
                text row is dashed.

        </div>


        <div class="spacer">
            <h3>Sticky Headers</h3>
            <div class="spacer">
                When scrolling a large table, the top of the table can disappear which can make it hard to remember what data
                the columns represent. When this happens the top of the screen "holds onto" the column header row. Click to
                <button class="sbss"

                        style="margin-left:5px;"
                        onclick="var example = document.getElementById('example'); example.src = 'DocHtml/SampleTable.html'; example.parentElement.style.display = 'block'">
                    Open the Sample Table to Scroll
                </button>
                and to
                <button class="sbss"
                        title="Closes the sample table"
                        style="margin-left:5px;"
                        onclick="var example = document.getElementById('example'); example.parentElement.style.display = 'none'">
                    Close the Sample Table
                </button>
                <div id="exampleContainer" class="spacer" style="height:260px; width:720px; display:none;">
                    <iframe id="example" style="border: solid 1px firebrick;
                                                border-radius: 10px;
                                                width:95%; height:260px;">

                The tool-tips are still displayed when the header is "stuck". Sticky headers work for all tables that have a
                column header row in the Header section even when the table is nested.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="spacer">
            <h3>Tool Tips &ndash; Revisited</h3>
            <div class="spacer">
                The tables are composed of a title and column headers and
                columns of data. The column header text (for example player stats, like AB, TH, OPS, etc.) are
                documented in the "Definitions, Explanations &amp; Details" page. For all tables when you
                hover over the column header text, a tool tip pops open for as long as you keep hovering over the cell.
                This can be quite helpful if you're
                not sure what the data represents. Here's an example of the tool tip for the
                column header text "TH":

                <div>
                    <img src="Images/ToolTip.png" />
                </div>

                Some tables don't have columns headers but the first cell in a row acts as the "header" for the row. In this case,
                hovering over the first cell text in each row provides a tool tip. For example, here's the "Rankings" table in
                a row of the "Player Summary Stats" table in the "Game Results, Teams and Players" page:

                <div>
                    <img src="images/RankingsToolTip.png" />
                </div>

                Be aware that tool tips are only displayed for table column header text in general. There are
                exceptions where table values actually have tool tips, and that's for Percentiles, Rankings, Z-scores and
                league summary in the "Player
                Sheets" page. This is done because the information is inserted in the player's table only when the data
                is relevant (that is, enough plate appearances to be part of the calculations) and is not really part of the table.
                <div>
                    <img src="images/PercentilesToolTip.png" />
                </div>

                <div class="spacer">
                    Although not a classic tool tip, some of the tables display a photo (if available) of the player with summary
                    or additional data. Open up the "Sample Table" and hover over a player name. You'll see
                    their photo and perhaps some (not) useful information. It's just kind of fun.
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="spacer">
            <h3 id="SortableTables">Sortable Tables</h3>
            <div class="spacer">
                All player stats tables, nested or not, are sortable. When a page is displayed you see a down-arrow
                icon indicating that the table is ordered in descending order based upon the values in that column.
                If you click on the column again, that table is
                displayed in ascending order. Here's what see if PA (Plate Appearances) is the initial column when
                page is displayed:

                <div>
                    Try it for the <a onclick="openPopup('SampleTable')" style="color: #00ee">Sample Table</a> and for the
                    <a onclick="openPopup('SampleGTPTables')" style="color: #00ee">Nested Tables</a>.
                </div>

                <div class="spacer">
                    If you click another (numeric) column, the icons on the current column disappear and you see the down arrow and the
                    table is sorted in descending order by the values in the clicked column. The player name column is just the opposite: When
                    you first click on it the table is ordered in ascending order by player last name (then first name). If you click on it again,
                    the table is order in descending order by player last name (then first name).

        <div class="spacer">
            The SBSS Data Viewer lets you view accumulated stats and statistics in unique ways from games played. This allows
            you to more easily view and certainly to evaluate and compare stats. But where does the data come from?
        </div>
        <div class="spacer">
            The data is gathered from the public and official
            <a href="https://saddlebrookesoftball.com" target="_blank">SaddleBrooke Senior Softball Association (SSSA)</a> site.
            Volunteer score keepers create the score sheets for each game played. At some point during the same day, the score 
            sheets are recorded in the SSSA server and the updated data is available for viewing from the SSSA web site.
            It is a remarkable commitment and service to all that are interested in the data. I certainly appreciate all the
            work and commitment.
        </div>
        <div class="spacer">
            After the data has been recorded, any new data is recovered from the SSSA site web pages (called page scraping)
            and stored in the 
            SBSS Data Viewer data store, which is just a JSON (Javascript Object Notation) file. It's my intent to make these files
            available for download (why not, it's not my data after all). The only data that is captured is schedule information and
            player stats. Computed stats (AVC, SLG, OBP, OPS) are not captured, but rather calculated while saving data. Summary
            data is always created by the Data Viewer. If you see any discrepancies between the Data Viewer and the SSSA site,
            please assume the SSSA site is correct, and please let <a href="index.html#feedback" target="_blank">me</a> know so 
            we can fix the issue.
        </div>

            Scraping the pages every week day keeps the data store up to date. The process is totally automated to reduce
            any errors creeping in. For a typical day, the process takes less than 30 seconds to find all changes, update the data
            store, reconstruct the HTML data pages, and upload any changes to the sbssdata.info server. Happy viewing.

            But nothing is perfect. In fact it is the enemy of good enough! But sometimes mistakes are made, 
            and the SSSA data is changed
            after it has been after recovered by the SBSS Data Viewer and saved in its data store. 
            On a regular basis, a Data Viewer application is run to 
            find any changes made in the SSSA data and moves those changes to the SBSS Data Viewer data store. If you find that
            there are discrepancies between the Data Viewer and the SSSA site, it may well because the changes haven't been
            transfer yet. Our experience is that changes are few and far between.

        One last thing! When I said you can dismiss the pop-ups of the sample tables by clicking anywhere outside the pop-up,
        that's technically true. But in a couple of cases, the pop-up isn't dismissed, it's just replaced. Tell me how I did
        that and you win a prize!
