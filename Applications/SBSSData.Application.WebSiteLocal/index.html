                    (called the <span style="font-weight:bold">Data Store</span>) and is displayed using
                    three perspectives.

                            canceled or forfeited, the results for the teams and each of the players on the team are displayed.
                            This is a lot of data!

                            Second, there is a table that views the results from the team perspective,
                            so it shows the team standings and the player summaries for every game the team played.

                            the player. All stats (including ranking) for every player in every team in the
                            league is displayed. The
                            data for all leagues (typically 8 or 9) are displayed.

    <h2>Viewing Requirements</h2>
    <div>
        This Web site is best viewed in a desktop browser because of the size of the tables that can be nested and the number of tables.
        All pages render on a phone but can be hard to navigate and see everything. This has only been tested on chromium
        browsers (Chrome and Edge) and Android and iPhones. Your mileage may vary.
    </div>
    <div class="space">
        When you select a link to a page, if it is displayed same tab, to go back previous page just click on the link that is
        part of the page header. See the <a href="Notices.html">Things to Note &amp; Information</a> page for more detailed information
        about the site structure.
