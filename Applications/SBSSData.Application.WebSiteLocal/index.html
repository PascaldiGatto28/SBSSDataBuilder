    <h2 id="UsingTables">Using the Data Viewer Tables</h2>
    <div class="spacer">
        Data is presented as tables, and when there's a lot of data it can be hard to navigate. But all tables can
        be collapsed or expanded by clicking on the table header anywhere within the text of the table header. And when there are a
        lot of tables, buttons are available to collapse or expand all tables on the page. Try clicking on the table header above.
        When a table is expanded, the arrow to the left of the header text is up and the bottom border of the table is solid.
        If the arrow is down
        and the bottom border is dashed, the table is collapsed and can be expanded, by clicking on the header text. Finally
        the table column header text is "sticky" &mdash; when you scroll down, and the table is visible, the table header 
        remain attached
        to the top of browser until you scroll past the table.
    </div>
    <h3>Tool Tips</h3>
    <div>
        The tables are composed of a title and column headers and
        columns of data. The column header text (for example player stats, like AB, TH, OPS, etc.) are
        documented in the ""Definitions, Explanations &amp; Details"" page. For all tables when you
        hover over the column header text, a tool tip pops open for a few seconds. This can be quite helpful if you're
        not sure what the data represents. Here's an example of the tool tip for the
        column header text "TH":

        <div>
            <img src="Images/ToolTip.png" />
        </div>

        Some tables don't have columns headers but the first cell in a row acts as the "header" for the row. In this case,
        hovering over the first cell text in each row provides a tool tip. For example, here's the "Rankings" table in
        a row of the "Player Summary Stats" table in the "Game Results, Teams and Players" page:

        <div>
            <img src="images/RankingsToolTip.png" />
        </div>

        Be aware that tool tips are only displayed for table column header text in general. There are
        exceptions where table values actually have tool tips, and that's for Percentiles, Rankings, Z-scores and
        league summary in the "Player
        Sheets" page. This is done because the information is inserted in the player's table only when the data
        is relevant (that is, enough plate appearances to be part of the calculations) and is not really part of the table.
        <div>
            <img src="images/PercentilesToolTip.png" />
        </div>
    </div>

    <h3 id="SortableTables">Sortable Tables</h3>
    <div>
        Some player tables are sortable. When a page is displayed you see a down-arrow
        icon indicating that the table is ordered in descending ordered based upon the values in that column. 
        If you click on the column again, that table is
        displayed in ascending order. Here's what see if PA (Plate Appearances) is the initial column when
        page is displayed and then when it is clicked again:

        <div>
            <img src="images/SortIcons.png" />
        </div>

        If you click another (numeric) column, the icons on the current column disappear and you see the down arrow and the
        table is sorted in descending order by the values in the column. The player name column is just the opposite: When
        you first click on it the table is ordered in ascending order by player last (then first name). If you click on it again,
        the table is order in descending order by player last name (then first name).

        <div class="spacer">
            As of this writing, the only sortable player stats table in on the
            <a href="SortablePlayerStats.html" class="navigateFrom">Players Leagues Stats &amp; Statistics</a> page, but that 
            may be extended as needed in future releases.
        </div>
    </div>

    <h3>Viewing Requirements</h3>
    <div>
        This Web site is best viewed in a desktop browser because of the size of the tables that can be nested and the number of tables.
        All pages render on a phone but can be hard to navigate and see everything. This has only been tested on chromium
        browsers (Chrome and Edge) and Android and iPhones. Your mileage may vary.
    </div>
    <div class="space">
        When you select a link to a page, if it is displayed same tab, to go back previous page just click on the link that is
        part of the page header. See the <a href="Notices.html">Notes &amp; Information</a> page for more detailed information
        about the site structure.
    </div>
