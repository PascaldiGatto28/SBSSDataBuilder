                "Lies, damned lies, and statistics" is a phrase describing the persuasive power of
                statistics to bolster weak arguments, "one of the best, and best-known" critiques of
                applied statistics. It is also sometimes colloquially used to doubt statistics used to
                prove an opponent's point.

                The phrase was popularized in the United States by Mark Twain (among others),
                who attributed it to the British prime minister Benjamin Disraeli. However, the phrase
                is not found in any of Disraeli's works and the earliest known appearances were years
                after his death. Several other people have been listed as originators of the quote,
                and it is often attributed to Twain himself."
