        Things to Note &amp; Information

    <div class="spacer">
        Thank you for taking the time and energy to look at this Web site and hope you'll offer any comments and suggestions. There
        are some items of which we'd like to offer to provide a context when looking at SBSS Data Viewer.
    </div>

        <li class="sbss" stye="margin-bottom:15px;">
            Although all the data is recovered from the SaddleBrook Senior Softball Association (SSSA) Web site, here the
            data is presented
            often in different ways and include descriptive statistic of the stats.
            The SSSA Web is the <span class="emphasis">Official Web site of SSSA</span> for both
            news, notices and <span class="emphasis">data</span>. If there are any data discrepancies between the two,
            you should view the SSSA site as the correct source. Any errors are ours, and I'll address them immediately.
        </li>
        <li class="sbss">
            It is my desire to be a complementary source and definitely not a replacement for the SSSA Web site. Our goal 
            is to provide the data in a
            way that makes is easy to see all data in one place as well as to do some interesting and perhaps
            useful analysis,
        </li>
        <li class="sbss">
            The SBSS Data Viewer is a prototype. The pages have been generally hand-crafted in a way to reflect the organization
            of the stored data.
            The rendering is rudimentary at this point, but after we get a better idea of the way we and you would like us to
            present data, and if there's interest, we'll develop a more modern responsive Web site. Any comments, suggestions
            and feedback are welcomed and appreciated.
        </li>
        <li class="sbss">
            The SBSS Data Viewer is a static Web site. The advantage is that the pages do not require specific requests from
            you. The disadvantage is that you lose the interaction that real applications provide, but the big advantage
            is that we don't request any information from you and only use a single cookie that keeps track which season
            you have selected. That cookie is removed when your browser is closed.
        </li>
        <li class="sbss">
            Because the site is static and you're not sending any personal information over the wire, there is no danger that
            your information in compromised. Even though the SBSS Data Viewer is safe, modern browsers expect 
            (as they should) that a
            Web site use the "https protocol" (<b>h</b>yper<b>text</b> <b>t</b>ransfer <b>p</b>rotocol secure). 
            What that does is encrypt the data transferred
            between your browser and the Web site server. To use the https protocol, the server requires a certificate, which
            we have not done at this time. This has two impacts: First, when accessing SBSS Data Viewer, you must use
            "http://www.sbssdata.info", "www.sbssdata.info", or even just "sbssdata.info" rather than "https." Second, most
            browsers indicate that the site is "Not secure" and warn you that:
            <div style="margin-top:10px;">
                <div style="width:55%; border: 1px solid #aaaaaa; padding:5px 10px 5px 10px; margin:auto; font-style:italic">
                    This site does not have a certificate.<br />
                    Because this connection is not secure, information (such as passwords or credit cards)
                    will not be securely sent to this site and may be intercepted or seen by others.
                </div>
            </div>
        </li>
        <li class="sbss">
            There is no cost to use this site and never will be. All the source code used to acquire data, store it and display
            it via the Web is in the public domain currently hosted on <a href="https://github.com" _target="blank">Github</a>
            at the public repository 
            <a href="https://github.com/PascaldiGatto28/SBSSDataBuilder" _target="blank">SBSS Data Builder</a>
            (more information on that and technical documentation are coming).
        </li>
        <li class="sbss">
            Because this a prototype and under construction, we do try and offer a fair bit of guidance, but are planning
            to keep it off the main data pages so it doesn't get in the way. Please however, do at least look at the guide pages
            before diving into the data. 
        </li>
        <li class="sbss">
            Finally, a big thanks to all the volunteer score keepers and George Corrick that maintain the 
            SSSA Web site make this site possible. Also thank you for reading this document. 
            We hope you like SBSS Data Viewer and are looking forward to hearing from you.
