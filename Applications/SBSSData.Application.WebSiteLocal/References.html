                 <h3 style="margin-bottom:0px;">Notes</h3>
                 <ol style="margin-left:-20px;">
                     <li>
                         A box score in baseball and softball is a stats summary of a game. It records the numbers of runs and
                         hits as well as the batting order, individual player stats, and other important
                         information about the game. In our leagues we don't record anything but batting and scoring stats. We
                         don't record runs batted in (RBI) or errors. Sometimes less is more, because to require our
                         score keepers to make judgments on subjective items is problematic. What is done, is done very well by
                         the SSSA dedicated volunteers.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                         All calculated values use data from the box scores, and are not copied from the SSSA Web site.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                         The calculated "averages"and "percentages" are rounded up to three decimal places. For example 13/27 is
                         0.48148+, but is recorded as ".481" where as 40/61 is 0.65573+ so is recorded as ".656".
                     </li>
                     <li>
                         The terms averages and percentages are an abuse of language, but within the context of baseball/softball
                         stats it is understood that terms are essentially interchangeable. In SBSS Data Viewer these are all
                         fractions of one value over another (for example, BA is AB/TH) rounded to three decimals.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                         When calculating summary statistics, the box score values for the players are added to the data
                         store and the other stats are calculate from those.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                         In some cases, for example the summary stats for the players on a team, the number of games they
                         played is also displayed as part of the stats. The values are calculated like all summary data and
                         ultimately depends only the box score stats for the players involved.
                     </li>

         <h2 id="Percentiles">Percentiles and Ranking</h2>
         <div class="spacer">
             <div class="spacer">
                 Both percentiles and ranking are ways of looking at data. A <b>Percentile</b> is the value for which a percentage of
                 the entire data is less than the value. For example, the 25th percentile is that value for which 25% of the data
                 items are below the value. The <b>Ranking</b> of a data item represents the relative standing of
                 that particular data item value within the entire data. For example, if the data item is greater than all others, it
                 has rank 1; if there are three items bigger than its value, it has rank 4.
             </div>
             <div class="spacer">
                 A simple example related to the data in SBSS Data Viewer is a good way to start. Here are the batting averages for
                 26 players compiled from all the games they played in this league (for example, "Friday Competitive").

                 <div class="spacer" style="font-family: Consolas, monospace; max-width: 1020px;
                                           font-size: .75em; border: 1px solid #808080;
                                           padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px; margin-top:10px;">
                     750, .600, .675, .667, .821, .487, .632, .722, .500, .645,
                     .600, .441, .824, .613, .483, .645, .600, .630, .556, .692, .778, .850, .706, .429, .750, .833
                 </div>

                 Looking at Player23 (whose average is .706), their rank is the number of players having an average higher
                 than theirs plus 1. In this example player23 has rank 9. Again, the rank is 9, because there are 8 averages greater
                 than player23's average.
             </div>
             <div class="spacer">
                 Rankings are useful, but they don't really tell you much about the data as whole and how it compares to a
                 single data item (say Player23). What if the data had 65 items, or just 10 &mdash; the rank doesn't distinguish between
                 those two cases. Since we're only looking at 26 entries, just "eye-balling" gives you a good idea. The percentile is
                 a single number (not a percentage) that can allow you to compare players.
             </div>

                 The solution to calculating both rank and percentile is to order the data (in ascending order) and then just do a
                 little counting. Here's the ordered data:

                 <div class="spacer" style="font-family:Consolas, monospace; max-width:1020px;
                                           font-size:.75em; border:1px solid #808080;
                                           padding:10px 20px 10px 20px; margin-top:10px">
                     429, .441, .483, .487, .500, .556, .600, .600, .600, .613, .630, .632, .645, .645, .667, .675, .692,
                     .706, .722, .750, .750, .778, .821, .824, .833, .850
                 </div>

                 Now that the data is ordered to calculate both. Just count from the "right" until you get to Player23 and that
                 is their rank; count from the left until you to just before Player23 and divide that number by the size of the
                 entire data (26). That ratio is 65.38+ which tells us that Player23 is not only 8 from top, but nearly two
                 thirds of the players have an battering average less than Player23's average. We say that Player23 is in the
                 65th percentile.
                 If you've ever taken a standardized test (and if you haven't, you're lucky, and I salute you 👍🏻), the way it is
                 "graded" is to tell your percentile. It doesn't tell you your score, but it does tell that you how you did
                 in comparison to the rest of the test-takers.
             </div>
             <div class="spacer">
                 In the Player Sheets page each player has both their rank and percentile (and soon z-scores) if
                 they've had enough to plate appearances in the league. Player23 looks something like this:

                 </div>
                 Please note this data was from an earlier period and is just an example. See below for more current
                 examples.

         <div class="spacer">
             <h3>What is a Z-score?</h3>
             <div class="spacer">
                 A z-score measures the distance between a data point (in our case a stat value) and the mean (or &#x3bc;) of those
                 stats for the league using standard deviations (StdDev or &#x3c3;). Not much help you say,
                 because I've answered a question by creating two more.
             </div>
             <div class="spacer">
                 The mean (&#x03bc;) is just the average of
                 all the league data &ndash; the sum of the (weighted) values divided by the number of data values. Well not
                 quite, but we'll get back to that.
             </div>
             <div class="spacer">
                 The standard deviation (&#x3c3;) is a measure of how the data is distributed. It's another average really,
                 basically the average of all "squared distances" of each stat data item from the mean (&#x3bc;).
                 Instead of dividing by the number of stat data values, we divide by the standard deviation (&#x3c3;). 
                 The result is a
                 single number that gives you a sense of where the data item lies in the entire list of data. 
             </div>
             <div class="spacer">
                 It's not a number
                 that represents AVG, SLG, OB or OPS, its just a statistic (a number that describes the data) similar to
                 rank and percentiles. Even though we use the word stat and statistics interchangeably when talking about 
                 batting data, statistic in our context are things about the data, not the data itself. Usually context
                 makes the distinction clear, but we try and always  use "stats" for data and 
                 "statistics" for stuff (numbers or concepts) about the data.
             </div>
             <div class="spacer">
                 The sign tells you whether the stat value is above or below the mean value typically for a league.
                 For example, a z-score of +1.12 indicates
                 that the data value falls 1.12 standard deviations above the mean, while a -1.12 signifies it is 1.12 standard
                 deviations (&#x3c3;s) below the mean  (&#x3bc;) of all the league data.

             <h3>An Example &mdash; Awesome Player</h3>
             <div class="spacer">
                 "Awesome Player" is a fictional player, but the data is real (to protect the innocent). Here's Awesome's player
                 sheet as of 06/09/2024 (free beer to the real person whose values they are and anyone who guess correctly).
                 What follows is not an image, but a real interactive player sheet. You can expand and collapse the tables, and
                 better yet you can hover over the table header and the statistical values (Percentiles, Rankings and Z-scores) to
                 see explanations of the data via tool tips.

                 tips that are displayed.
             </div>
             <div>
                 But there's more. If you hover over the league computed stats, you'll see the &#x3bc; (mean) and
                 &#x3c3; (standard deviation) of each of the
                 stats. Read on to see how the z-scores are calculated from these statistics. But first&nbsp;==>
             </div>

             <h3>Why Z-scores are Useful</h3>
             <div class="spacer">
                 Standardizing the raw stats by transforming the stats into z-scores give the following capabilities:
                 <ul style="margin-left:-20px">
                     <li>
                         <span style="font-style:italic">
                             Understand where a player's stat value fits in a distribution of all the league values.
                         </span><br/>
                         Graphing z-scores against stat values for all players is an interesting and useful way to see how the
                         stat data is distributed. You can expect graphs to be soon available as part of the SBSS Data Viewer!
                     </li>

                     <li>
                         <span style="font-style:italic">
                             Compare stats between different types.
                         </span><br/>
                         Because the z-score is just a description of the stat's location among all (typically league) stats
                         you're analyzing, the numbers have the same meaning for the different stat types. 
                         Admittedly AVG and SLG are strongly related to OBP and OPS, but looking at z-scores for
                         all these gives an indication of where the player's strength lies. For example, is it AVG, SLG, or
                         OBP that provide the major contribution to the OPS stat.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                         <span style="font-style:italic">
                             Identify outliers, that is, values which are very unusual.
                         </span><br/>
                         Z-scores that are either greater than +3.5 or less than
                         -3.5 are extremely rare and often indicate that the number of plate appearance for the stat data is small.
                     </li>
                 </ul>

                 <div class="spacer">
                     Here a couple of graphs that show what you can do with z-scores. The first is the distribution of OPS z-scores
                     for all community leagues in the 2024 Spring season as of this writing (06/09/2024). It plots the
                     number of players whose values are between z-scores. You can see that most of the data is within a single
                     standard deviation centered on the mean.
                 </div>
                 <img src="Images/OPSDistribution.png" />
                 <div class="spacer">
                     The next graph plots the z-scores against the actual OPS data. Each dot on the plotted line shows a single
                     z-score on the horizontal axis and the OPS stat value on the vertical axis that produced that z-score.
                     Again this is the same data used to produce the previous graph.
                 </div>
                 <img src="Images/OPSResults.png" />
                 <div class="spacer">
                     Both of these graphs illustrate that most stat values are centered around the mean of the data (remember a
                     z-score of 0 arises from a stat value equal to the mean). And a conclusion is that z-scores greater than +0.5
                     are truly exceptional, at least for this OPS stat.
                 </div>

             <div class="spacer">
                 We've been using the terms mean (&#x03bc;) and standard deviation (&#x03C3) carefully, but a little loosely. In

                 stats. Will use the data from Wednesday Community league, the same league that "Awesome Player" played in

                         The &#x03C3; is not much harder. Remember it is just the value of the sum of differences of each
                         item from the
                         &#x03BC; divided by the number of data items, n. Well that's a bit of problem because negative values would
                         cancel positive ones. We could use absolute values of differences but that can be inconvenient to
                         calculate. There's another to make sure all the differences are always positive &mdash; square the difference,
                         and then take that sum, which is called the sum of squares. Finally average that by dividing by n. This is
                         called the variance &mdash; it is basically the average of the "squared differences" (heard that before,
                         yes?). Here's the formula:

                         Just like the mean, except now we're averaging the sum of squared differences. Not exactly what we want,
                         but close. The sum of squared differences for our data is 2.805 and divided by 32, the variance is
                         0.088. In terms of "unit", the variance is "squares of difference from the mean", we want the average
                         of differences from the mean. And that is why the variance is viewed as &#x03C3; squared. So to get
                         &#x03C3;, we just take the square root:

                     different and that's the problem. You can use these values with the OPS value (top row, last cell)
                     to compute Awesome's z-score,
                     Turns out SBSS Data Viewer uses a slightly, but more accurate way
                     of calculating these statistics.

                     <div class="spacer">
                         Here's the problem: Suppose you have just four players with OPS values of [4.000, 1.500, 1.600, 1.700]. If
                         you just go through the exercise we've just been through, you'd get 
                         &#x03BC;&nbsp;=&nbsp;2.200 and &#x03C3;&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.042.
                         But now also suppose their plate appearances are [1, 30, 25, 23]. It makes no sense that the &#x03BC;
                         is lower than all the values because a player who was only at bat once (albeit, they hit a home run) 
                         makes the statistic meaningless. Admittedly this is not a real example, and our data is not likely to
                         have wildly different values, but still it's best to get it right.
                     </div>
                     <div class="spacer">
                         One fix is throw out all values that are outliers &mdash; throwing away data is serious and bad
                         karma. Somehow you have to compute the statistics by weighting the data so this is not an issue,
                         and then report z-scores for non-outliers.
                         Okay, you're probably asking why didn't you say this at the beginning &mdash; it's much easier to
                         explain weighted statistics after you're exposed and comfortable with the standard case.

                     <div class="spacer">
                         To compute the weighted mean, you have multiply each stat data value by the associated weight for that
                         stat value. In our case, we use the PA stats because the values are never 0 and are a good measure
                         of how active the player is. OPS values with larger PA make a greater contribution to
                         the sum of values than those that have smaller PA. The formula is quite similar to the standard non-weighted
                         version except that you multiple each OPS value by the PA for that entry. You can think about this as
                         replicating the OPS stat value PA times. If you view it that way, it is clear that you must divide by the sum
                         of the weights (PA values) rather than n, the number of OPS values. Here's the formula:

                         The sum of the weights (sum of PA values) is 452 (think of this as the new "n"). The sum of the products
                         of weight (PA) multiple by associated OPS is 628.192. So the weighted &#x3BC;&nbsp;=&nbsp; is 1.390

                         Again mimicking the formula for the unweighted case, we need only find the sum of squared differences
                         between the OPS values and weighted
                         &#x3BC; to find
