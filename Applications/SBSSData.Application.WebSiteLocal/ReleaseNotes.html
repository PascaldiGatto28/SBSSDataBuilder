    </div>
    <div class="spacer" style:margin=bottom:20px;>
        Two big items in this release: (1) All tables having player stats are now sortable, and (2) documentation for all
        SBSS Data Viewer table features and properties are documented in the 
        <a href="AboutTables.html" target="blank">About Tables</a> page.
        A link to the page is now the first item in the Table of Contents on the home page, and is a must read (and entertaining).
        <ul class="sbss">
            <li>
                Page titles (the text that appears in the browser tab) have been reviewed and shortened where possible.
            </li>
            <li>
                Text to describe how to change the active season has been added to the home page.
            </li>
            <li>
                Now that we have a page that documents Data Viewer tables, we removed any redundant text for other pages, including
                the home page. It helps keep pages focused on the topic content.
            </li>
            <li>
                The page that describes items you should be aware when using SBSS Data Viewer has been renamed
                <a href="Notices.html">Things to Note &amp; Information</a> and the contents updated. All links to this page
                have been updated.
            </li>
            <li>
                The usual number (too large) of minor text changes and some HTML formatting have been completed.

    <div class="spacer" style:margin=bottom:20px;>
        The Summer 2024 is in full activity now, so the default season is now changed from the Spring 2024 to the Summer 2024, but
        remember you can select any season you want using the "Seasons Button" on the home page. There are now five seasons
        available. Unlike our release last week, this
        is a big one and has a significant (and I hope useful) new feature
        <ul class="sbss">
            <li>
                Yet another a page! "Players Leagues Stats &amp; Statistics", contains tables for every league and player
                summary stats and statistics for each of the leagues. The center piece is the player stats table that is
                sortable on every stat, statistic and player name. The sortable table is in response to suggestions from
                our visitors to the <a href="http://www.sbssdata.info">SBSS Data Viewer</a> Web site. Even if you don't want to
                view the full statistics, hovering over the player's name displays their photo with a summary of the data.
                If you're into statistics, there is enough data on the page to calculate player z-Scores if you don't believe me
                (which you definitely should not)!
            </li>
            <li>
                Button styling has changed to show different shade of color when hovering over or clicking on the button. The
                buttons (except the "ShowMe" buttons on the "guide" pages) also have tool tips when you hover over them.
            </li>
            <li>
                The home page has been restyled a bit, added the link to the new page, and added information for sortable tables.
            </li>
            <li>
                When you click on link to one the "Guide" pages, the guide is opened in the same tab to make it easier
                to return to the home page or the original page.
            </li>
            <li>
                Lots of small changes to improve textual content and styling. If you don't notice, I guess that's a good
                thing.

        This is a minor release getting ready for the Summer 2024 season. The Summer 2024 schedule is complete, but until there's
        a week's worth of data, Spring 2024 will remain as the default season. You can, nonetheless, select the Summer 2024 season
        and see all the data so far. Summer 2024 will be the default season starting July 21.
        <ul class="sbss">
            <li>
                The table of contents on the home page has been changed again. Links to the guides for both "Player Sheets" and
                "Game Results, Teams and Players" can be found on those pages. The order and description of the links on the
                home page has been altered slightly for consistency and clarity.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Spoiler Alert</b> &mdash; Coming soon!  A new page summarizing League and Player stats and statistics
                for all players for
                each league is nearing completion. The tables containing player data are sortable by any stat. Later
                player tables on other pages will be sortable. If you'd like to be notified when new features and changes are
                available, send me an email at

    <div class="spacer" style:margin=bottom:20px;>
        Lots of little things, but the big (no, huge) thing is that Z-scores are now included in the Player Sheets.
        <ul class="sbss">
            <li>
                Implementing Z-scores required building a lot of infrastructure to build and display the statistic. You'll
                notice that, of course, in the Player Sheets (and Guide to) data page. It has been worked into the tables
                the way we display percentiles and rankings. The other place is in the
                <a href="References.html#Statistics">Definitions, Explanations &amp; Details</a> page. I hope you find that
                useful and interesting.
            </li>
            <li>
                Speaking of the statistics, we removed the link to "Lies, Damned Lies and Statistics" because it's
                still empty, but the "Definitions, Explanations &amp; Details" page gives a glimpse of what we're working
                on next.
                We expect to have graphs and plots for all the leagues in the next release, sometime during next season. We
                really do need to get some feedback to help us to spend the time with what you find important.
            </li>
            <li>
                In general, the table of contents of the main page has been altered to reflect use cases. The notice
                at the top of the page has been removed, but the link will not be remove of course.
            </li>
            <li>
                A whole lot of text changes, a few simple bug fixes also completed. Not every bug is a feature, but some
                are and some bugs are features. Sounds of Yogi Berra.

                The program that checks for changes in the game schedules (played, canceled, etc.) now runs at 6:20 PM rather
                than at 8:30 PM on every weekday.
                That program takes about 5  to 10 seconds to run, and the program that builds Web site pages and publishes all
                changed pages to the sbssdata.info Web site
                takes about 10 to 15 seconds to run. You should be able to see all changes by 6:30 PM (Arizona time).

                The "Data Store Information" page now displays all the games where data was recovered from box scores as
                recorded games rather than completed games. This affected of a number of other
                pages including the "The recovered data store:" event in the Log Sessions table. Published on May 18, 2024.

                The "Player Summary Stats" for a team in the "Game Results, Teams and Players" page, did not expand the

        Version 0.11.24137 released Thursday, May 16 2024
    </div>

    <div class="spacer" style:margin=bottom:20px;>
        A lot of clean-up and a few import bug fixes. Also a couple new features that don't change any of the data
        but should make reading a little more clear. Rather than waiting for all changes to be wrapped in a single
        release, they are published to SBSSData.info site after testing. Nonetheless, these notes document
        those changes since the previous release.
        <ul class="sbss">
            <li>
                This is just "I can't make up my mind" moment. Again, where these notes appear is changing to make sure
                this main page doesn't get too large or crowded. Now all notes will be in this "Version History" page,
                A stub is left in home page just so you know
                something new has happened. Tell me what you think &mdash; bad, good, not important, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
                The main vehicle for displaying player, team and league stats are tables which are composed of title and then
                columns of data. The column header text (for example player stats, like AB, TH, OPS, etc.) are
                documented in the ""Definitions, Explanations &amp; Details"" page. With this release, for all tables (every single one of them!), when you
                hover over the column header, a tool tip pops open for a few seconds. Here's an example of the tool tip for the
                column header text "TH":

                <div>
                    <img src="Images/ToolTip.png" />
                </div>

                Some tables don't have columns header but the first cell in a row acts as the "header" for the row. In this case,
                hovering over the first cell text in each row provides a tool tip. For example, here's the "Rankings" table in
                a row of the "Player Summary Stats" table in the "Game Results, Teams and Players" page:

                <div>
                    <img src="images/RankingsToolTip.png" />
                </div>

                Be aware that tool tips are only displayed for table column headers in general. There are only a couple of
                exceptions where table values actually have tool tips, and that's for Percentiles and Rankings in the "Player
                Sheets" page. This is done because the information is inserted in the player's table only when the data
                is relevant and is not really part of the table.

                <div>
                    <img src="images/PercentilesToolTip.png" />

                References to seasons are now in the format calendar season followed by year. So instead of "2024 Spring",
                you'll now see "Spring 2024". A number of pages are affected by this change, including the
                new "Data Store Information" page. This change put the season titles more in line with the
                SSSA Web site. Published on May 14.
            </li>
            <li>
                Wording of Log Session events improved but broke rendering of the "Log Sessions" table heading,
                but that is now fixed and was published on May 14.
            </li>
            <li>
                The currently selected season is now displayed on the right edge of the page header line to
                provide feedback to remind
                you what season you've selected. Published on May 13.

                On the "Games Results, Teams and Players" page, tThe column headers in the Teams and Players table of the
                Games Results Table were incorrect. That has been fixed and published on May 12.
            </li>

            <li>
                During this first week of games, player rankings and percentiles are not very useful because there's
                so little data. Currently at least 12 plate appearances in a league that they play in. That has been
                changed to at least 6 so that we can display some information &mdash; the reason for 6 is that likely
                means that they've played in at least 2 games in the league. We'll increase number as the seasons
                progresses and would appreciate your suggestion and feedback.

            <li>
                A new Data Store Information page has been deployed. It now displays data store
                information for at least 4 seasons including the current one. You may find the comparisons interesting.
                Perhaps you've gathered that one of the objectives of the SBSS Data Viewer is not only to show player, team
                and league stats data, but their relations to one another and comparisons within them.
                This change is part is a reflection of that objective.
            </li>
            <li>
                The "Player Sheets" page has the number of player displayed in the first line of the list of all players. For
                example, of this writing, the first which displays all the player sheets, read "View All 83 Players"
                instead of just "View All".

                The header for pages have a corrected no-cache meta tag. If you are getting content that appears old, do

                Fixed some typos in the "Definitions, Explanations &amp; Details" page and cleanup some descriptions, particularly the section

            </li>
            <li>
                When switching to another season, the number of players and teams was not correctly displayed in
                the "Data Store Information" page. The bug has been fixed.
            <li>
                The "Table of Contents" has been modified to keep the data pages and guides together at the top and
                informational pages below. The "Definitions, Explanations &amp; Details" link description in the table of contents
                has been updated to include percentiles and ranking information. The "Version History" link has been
                removed. Now you access the all previous release notes using the

                The biggest (and most important) feature for this release in the introduction of percentiles and ranks
                on the Player Sheets page. This allows to see summary data for any active player, their rank and percentiles
                for each of AVG, SLG, OB, OPS stats. Be sure and check the
                <a href="References.html#Percentiles">Definitions, Explanations &amp; Details</a> page for information about these additional stats, how they're used
                and calculated. This change required many other supporting changes as well.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Spring 2024 season has been added to the drop-down list to choose the season data you want to look at.
                It'll take a week after play starts for every league to have data.
                If you look at a league with no activity, you won't see any data, but you'll the normal introductory text.
                Because there won't be data for a week or two, the Winter 2024 is still default, but we'll change that once
                play begins.
                Remember that Log Sessions and the Data Store Information always use the current season which now is
                Spring 2024. There is an entry the Log Sessions entry which shows the data store has been created. The
                Data Store Information page shows the number of leagues (8) and the number of scheduled games (64),
                but essentially everything else is zero.
            </li>
            <li>
                Lots of small changes to text and HTML to the "Data Store Information" to support the existence of forfeited games.
                These are things that are just from the inclusion of a new category of games "played" that I forgot about.

                The message at the top of the home page asking to you to read "Notes &amp; Information" has been dialed back
                to be a little more subtle, and a typo was fixed.

                    On the last day of 2014 Winter games, we had a forfeited game which I didn't process properly from the update
                    program. That has been fixed. It's unique because the game in theory and has been played, but in
                    practice there is no player data. To quote an expert in such matters (Yogi Berra):
                    <span style="font-style:italic">
                        In theory there is no difference between theory and practice &mdash; in practice there is."
                    </span>
                    Practically speaking, the 7 runs allocated to the team that did not forfeit, and the number wins and losses
                    reflect the score in the team summary.
                    But since there's no player data, I do not display fictitious game player stats. Take a look at
                    the Friday Competitive Winter 2014 league from the
                    <a href="2024Winter/GamesTeamPlayersV3.html">Game Results, Teams and Players</a>,
                    you'll see 10 games of player data, but 11 games in the game overview.

                    This was mentioned in the previous release notes, but as reminder, the season cookie that keeps track of your
                    season selection is discarded when all instances of the browser you used are closed. In that case, when you
                    reenter the SBSS Data Viewer Web site, the default season (current or latest) is selected.

            Lots of changes in this release, some are trivial but useful, responding to suggestions and adding new features

                <a href="2024Winter/PlayerSheets.html">Player Sheets</a> is a new page that provides league-wide summary statistics
                for each player. The <a href="2024Winter/PlayerSheetsGuide.html">Guide to Player Sheets</a>
                is also available which is part of the process to move documentation away from the data pages.

                The <a href="Notices.html">Things to Note &amp; Information</a> page has been added to contain site-wide information
                but not necessarily to the data contained in the data pages. Very important to read this.

                Reference to "Ranking" in the
                <a href="2024Winter/GamesTeamPlayersV3.html">Game Results, Teams and Players</a> page
                changed to "Rankings". Not really important, but correct, because we plan to move to the use of percentiles
                rather than ranking to give a better idea of the distribution of the player statistics.
            </li>
            <li>
                Both player and summary statistics line items have standardized using abbreviations that are commonly
                accepted. We working on a reference page that will include this kind of information so we don't have
                describe in the many places it's used.

                Information about the data store has been removed except from the
                Data Store Log page. This is where it belongs because this page is
                about the Web site and not really about the data (it's meta data if you like).

                Added the "meta" tag to the head of all pages so the pages are not cached by the browser. This is important
