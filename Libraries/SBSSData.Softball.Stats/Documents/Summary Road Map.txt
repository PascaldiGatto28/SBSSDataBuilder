The current data store is organized by leagues. There are 9 leagues of 5 categories (Recreation, Side Winder, Coyote, Cummunity and Competitive). Each of leagues have scheduled games and when played, data for the game in encapsulated in 2 teams (Home and Visitors). The Team data contains all the player and their stats who played in that game.

The data store looks like this:

          Visitor Team Data

          Home Team Data
            Home Player Data (Replicated for each player)
            
There's a lot of data here: 9 leagues, 154 games (5 were cancelled) 298 team records (2 for each game played) 3040 player line scores from the 298 team scores and 159 distinct players (names) for the Fall 2023 season. For that reason, summarizing data with additional information is useful. Here's a list of the more obvious ways of looking at the and comparing data that is supported by SBSSData.Softball.Stats class library. In general. when comparing stats it only really makes sense by league or league category. For example, For example, comparing a community player with recreation player is dubious because capabilities are much different and the teams themselves are much different.

Teams
